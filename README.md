# Welcome to My Homework Repo :star2:

Hi! This is my STAT 545 homework repository. You can find the assignments I will be working on throughout this course here. 

## Who I am

I am a second-year MSc in Business Administration student at UBC Sauder School of Business :snake:. I did my BSc in Industrial Engineering/Operations Research/Management Sciences (I think all of these are used to refer my degree in Canada :smile:) in Turkey. I am very passionate about data and business analytics :point_right: Hence this course!
